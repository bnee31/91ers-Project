    <h2>
      <strong>Joy Fawcett</strong> is a former defender who played in four
      Women’s World Cups and three Olympic Games for the United States, winning
      four of those seven events, during a career that lasted from the last
      1980s until 2004. Fawcett, the sister of former U.S. men’s national team
      player Eric Biefeld, was still Joy Biefield when she made her first
      appearance in the national team, against Trinidad in 1987. When she
      retired in 2004, she had played 239 games for the US, including a total of
      54 in either the World Cup, the Olympics or qualifing for those events.
      Although she was not primary an attacking player, she did scored 27 goals
      in those 239 games, including a crucial one in the quarterfinal victory
      over Germany at the 1999 Women’s World Cup. She also had a remarkable
      disciplinary record in the national team. In her 239 games, she was never
      red carded and received only two yellow cards. She set a record of sorts
      in the first of her WUSA seasons by returning to play just six weeks after
      giving birth to her third child. She was inducted into the National Soccer
      Hall of Fame in 2009.
